Some program parts I use

 - ALhdf5: C++ glue to save data from std:: and boost::numeric::ublas containers to HDF5 data files
 - kahansum: Kahan and Neumaier summation
 - Procinp: C++ code to process human readable input (variable name, variable value pairs) into a program
 - reduce: some Reduce-algebra files I use often

IMPORTANT: All these pieces of software come with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY whatsoever. You may use them, and I would appreciate if you dropped me a line if you do so.

Most of these codes were written as parts of numerical codes for research papers. If you use them in the calculations for your own research paper, and you publish the paper, please do clarify with me the reference or the paper that code was written for, and cite accordingly.
